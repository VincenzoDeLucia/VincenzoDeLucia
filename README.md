# I'm Vincenzo, nice to meet you! #
I'm a **UX/UI Designer** and **front-end developer** from Italy.

My goal as a developer is to **make the web more accessible**.

I mainly work with vanilla **Html, CSS and Javascript**, but I've also worked with the **MERN stack** before. I also like to tinker with **Svelte**.

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincenzo-de-lucia/), or via [email](mailto:vincenzo.delucia@icloud.com), I love to talk shop!
